  <h1>About the city</h1>
  <p> Toronto is Canada's largest city and a world leader in such areas as business, finance, technology, entertainment and culture. Its large population of immigrants from all over the globe has also made Toronto one of the most multicultural cities in the world.
   <br> Travelling through Toronto will be your once-in-a-lifetime experience. The people of Toronto are certainly one of the most welcoming in the world. Besides, over 40% of them are also not native Canadians. It is the one city you will feel at home away from home.

  <h2>CN Tower</h2>
  <p> Toronto's famous landmark, the 553-meter CN Tower, is one of the city's must see attractions and also the most impossible to miss. Towering above the downtown, this Canadian icon can be seen from almost everywhere in the city. You have the option of simply appreciating the building from the ground, or taking a trip up to one of the observation areas or restaurants for fabulous views over the city and Lake Ontario. The CN Tower, built between 1972 and 1976, was once the tallest freestanding structure in the world, but has long since been surpassed.

  <h2>Ripley's Aquarium</h2>
  <p>One of Toronto's newest top attractions is the Ripley's Aquarium near the base of the CN Tower. This fabulous facility displays all kinds of marine life and is one of the most popular things to do in Toronto for families.

    The most impressive feature is the huge underwater tunnel with a moving sidewalk. You can watch the ocean world go by all around you as sharks glide past and sawfish linger on the tunnel roof above. This is a truly serene experience for all ages.</p>
